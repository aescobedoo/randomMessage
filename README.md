# Random message
Have you ever feel bored and find nothing to do? Well, this project could help you get out of the boredom zone for a little of time.

## Description
The project is meant to display a random message every time you run the porgram.
It works by having some arrays with different strings in them. Everytime you run the porgram it picks the arrays and then a string from each array.

## Codecademy
This project is included in the codecademy's “full stack engineer”. This is the description:

_For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking._

_Project Objectives:_

_Build a message generator program using JavaScript_
_Use Git version control_
_Use command line_
_Develop locally on your computer_
_Prerequisites:_

_JavaScript_
_Git and GitHub_
_Command line_
